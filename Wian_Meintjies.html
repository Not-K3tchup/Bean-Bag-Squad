                    The epoch-making event of the internet is usually seen as the demonstration of the 4-node ARPANET network in 1969, but a story as detailed as that of the Internet starts much earlier (Campbelly-Kell & Garcia-Swartz, 2013). Floridi(2009,2010) (as cited in Cohen-Almagor, 2010) argues that we are experiancing the fourth scientific revolution, this leaves us with the question of: Where did the information revolution start?</li>
            <li class="ollipiesang"> <h2 class="stylingheadingspiesang">World brain and stolen ideas</h2>
                Futurist HG Wells wrote his idea for a ‘World Brain’ in the 1930’s that the day is coming when any student, in any area of the world, will be able to sit in his own study with his projector and do his work or at his or her leisure to examine any book, document, in a precise duplicate (Campbelly-Kell & Garcia-Swartz, 2013). Well’s vision faded from view during WWII, but Vannevar Bush articulated a similar concept in the United States after the war in his article ‘As We May Think’ (Campbelly-Kell & Garcia-Swartz, 2013). Zahary(1997:265) ( as cited in Campbelly-Kell & Garcia-Swartz, 2013) states that the retoric seemed straigh from Wells himself. </li>
            <li class="ollipiesang"><h2 class="stylingheadingspiesang">The cold war</h2>
                    The history of the Internet started in the United States in the early 1960s during the Cold War period (Cohen-Almagor, 2010). Russia exploded its first atomic bomb in August of 1949, this showed the need for the United States to develop a new air defense system, this lead to the SAGE air defense system that was first deployed in 1962 (Edwards, 1996: 74-111) (as cited in Campbelly-Kell & Garcia-Swartz, 2013). During this same time period The Soviet Union launched the first space sattelite on 4 October 1957, this let to The US Department of Defense to respond by establishing the Advance Research Projects Agency (ARPA,2004) (as cited in Cohen-Almagor, 2010). ARPA had declared the goal of keeping the US military one step ahead of its adversaries by pursuing research projects that promise major advancements in defense-related domains (Abbate, 1999: 36; Lukasik, 2011) (as cited in Campbelly-Kell & Garcia-Swartz, 2013)</li>
            <li class="ollipiesang"><h2 class="stylingheadingspiesang">Licklider and and ARPA.</h2>
                    ‘Man Computer Symbiosis’, written by Licklider in 1960 (as cited in Campbelly-Kell & Garcia-Swartz, 2013), is one of the classics of computer science, advocating the use of the computer as a daily tool for knowledge work — an early vision of what we now term personal computing.
                        The Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) was one of ARPA's offices, and it funded computer science research in order to mobilize American universities and research laboratories to build a strategic communication network (Command and Control Research) that would provide the government with messaging capabilities (Curran & Seaton, 2009; Conn, 2002) (as cited in Cohen-Almagor, 2010).
                        J.C.R. Licklider, the first director of the Information Processing Techniques Office at ARPA, was appointed in 1962 (Cohen-Almagor, 2010) after he took leave from BBN to act as the director (Campbelly-Kell & Garcia-Swartz, 2013). Licklider proposed a "galactic" computer network, which would consist of a worldwide interconnected set of processing nodes that would allow anybody, anywhere, to access data and applications (Cohen-Almagor, 2010). It is said that during his time at ARPA Licklider would exercise considerable amounts of influence on the future of computing (Norberg and O’Neill, 2000; Abbate, 1999) (as cited in Campbelly-Kell & Garcia-Swartz, 2013).
                        Licklider and Welden Clark produced the first paper on the Internet concept in August 1962, titled ‘On-Line Man Computer Communication’ they viewed the communication network as a means of facilitating scientific collaboration (Cohen-Almagor, 2010).                         Donald Davies of the British National Physical Laboratory (NPL) created the term "packet" in 1965 when he began thinking about packet networks, in fact, three scientists in three distinct places were working on the same technology at the same time: Leonard Kleinrock was the first to develop the underlying principles of packet switching (Cohen-Almagor, 2010). Similarly, Davies believed that to
                        communicate between computers, a rapid message-switching communication service was required, in which large messages were broken into chunks and sent separately to avoid congestion (Cohen-Almagor, 2010).
                        Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) launched the ARPANET at the end of 1969 BBN was tasked with designing four Interface Message Processors (IMPs), machines that would allow open communication between four different computers running four different operating systems, resulting in the first long-haul computer network connecting the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in Menlo Park, California, and the University of California at Berkeley (UCB) (NWG).(Cohen-Almagor, 2010).</li>
