                The <strong> World Wide Web (WWWW) </strong>, also known as the Internet, is an internet-based information system in which
                files and other website resources are
                identified by <strong> Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) </strong>, which may be linked together via hyperlinks (Tobin,
                2012) (FAQ, 2015). <strong> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) </strong>
                is used to transfer online references, which may be obtained by users using a web browser and
                disseminated by a web server.

                The World Wide Web was founded in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, an English scientist. He invented the first
                web browser in 1990 while working at CERN in Geneva,
                (McPherson & Sammartino, 2009). The browser was first made accessible to other research organizations
                outside of CERN in January 1991, and then to the general
                public in August 1991. When webpages for public use were accessible in 1993–4, the Web began entering
                daily practice (Couldry, 2012). The World Wide Web is
                the primary means through which billions of people interact with the Internet, and it has played a key
                part in the Information Age's development (In, 2012).
                A website consists of a collection of web resources with a common theme and, in most cases, a single
                domain name. Websites are stored on computers that have a
                web server installed, which is a program that responds to requests received over the Internet by web
                browsers on the user's computer. A publisher can provide
                content for a website, or user-generated content can be used dynamically. Websites may be used for a
                wide range of purposes, including information,
                entertainment, commerce, and government.

                Usually, browsing a web page on the World Wide Web commences with either inputting the page's URL into a
                web browser or clicking on a backlink to that site or
                service. To acquire and present the requested page, the web browser initiates a signal of background
                communications. The word "web page" normally relates to
                what is displayed, but it can also apply to the substance of the computer file, which is typically a
                text file that contains hypertext written in HTML or a
                similar markup language. Hypertext links, often known as links, are used on most online pages to allow
                users to navigate to other web pages.

                A static web page is provided precisely as it is maintained in the web server's file system, as web
                content. A dynamic web page, on the other hand, is created
                by a web application that is generally powered by server-side software. When each visitor requires
                totally different information, such as bank websites or web
                email, dynamic web pages are utilized.
